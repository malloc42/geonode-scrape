# geonode-scrape
[GeoNode](https://geonode.com) is a web-based application and platform for developing geospatial information systems (GIS)<br>
and for deploying spatial data infrastructures (SDI).<br>
It is designed to be extended and modified, and can be integrated into existing platforms.<br>
It also offers [free proxies](https://geonode.com/free-proxy-list) and you can choose among the various parameters too unlike other free proxy sites.<br>

## [GeoNode](https://geonode.com/free-proxy-list) has a feature to import proxies with lots of data other than IP and Port.<br>

## Objective: To import the IP and PORT information from [GeoNode](https://geonode.com/free-proxy-list)'s free proxies.<br>

## Note
The site already has a filter functionality.<br>
This note is for those who would seek to customize this program itself according to their needs.
With enough knowhow, the program can be manipulated to work with more filters (country, upTime, latency, etc.)
E.g.: Filtering the proxies according to the location, latency and upTime to import more reliable proxies.
All parameters:
